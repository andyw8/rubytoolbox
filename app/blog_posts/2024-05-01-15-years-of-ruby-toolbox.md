# 15 years of Ruby Toolbox

Hello everyone, I hope you're well!

On this day 15 years ago, shortly before boarding a plane headed to RailsConf 2009 in Las Vegas,
I launched this website.

Back then, many rubyists were still struggling making the somewhat bumpy transition from the 1.8 to the 1.9 version
(which has become much less cumbersome ever since, thank you Ruby core team!),
Rails was in the middle of a big refactoring, later released as Rails 3.0.0, [after the merge with merb](https://yehudakatz.com/2008/12/23/rails-and-merb-merge/),
Rubygems were still hosted on RubyForge and Gemcutter, which later replaced it, was [released later in
the summer of 2009](http://www.rubyinside.com/gemcutter-a-fast-and-easy-approach-to-ruby-gem-hosting-2281.html).

The first version of this site was merely a Rake task fetching some data from the (still quite new!) GitHub API
and generating some static HTML files to be served by an Apache webserver from some tiny VPS.

It's great to see the Ruby community still grow, evolve and thrive after all these years, and I'm proud that
many found this website a useful resource along their journey and I was able to contribute to the community
through it.

My impression is that the attitude towards open source software maintainers has also come a long way during this
time, which is great, and initiatives like Ruby Central and the Rails Foundation are providing core infrastructure
of our open source community with the necessary financial backing - but please keep in mind to also support your
own favorite projects, help out on the issue trackers, donate some money, be kind to each other, so the Ruby community
can continue to grow and thrive for the next 15 years, and beyond!

Best,<br/>Christoph
