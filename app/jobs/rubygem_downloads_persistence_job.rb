# This job performs an upsert to store whatever downloads count is currently stored
# on each rubygem into the historical stats table rubygem_download_stats.
#
# * This job is scheduled hourly
# * It only actually runs on sundays, because we only currently need weekly stats anyway
# * If it already ran on a given day we don't care, we'll keep upserting until the day ends.
#   This is to ensure within reason that the job actually runs on every sunday without having
#   to put in place some complex persistent logic that actually keeps track of that.
