# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

          This metric tracks the **total number of times a library has been downloaded from Rubygems.org**.

          A **high number of downloads** indicates a **high popularity of the library** within the Ruby community.

          Starring is [GitHub's way of bookmarking source code repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/about-stars/).
          A **high number of stars** indicates that **a lot of users are interested in this library**.

    github_repo_forks_count:
      label: Forks
      description:
        |
          This metric shows **how often the source code repository has been forked on GitHub**.

          > A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment
          > with changes without affecting the original project.
          >
          > Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to
          > use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.
          >
          > <small>**Source: [GitHub Documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)**</small>

          A **high number of forks** can **indicate an active development community around a library**.

          However if **a library becomes unmaintained** users of a library might have continued maintaining their
          own patched variants of a library via forks. This **can lead to [community-owned forks](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/projects/cancancan)**
          or, in worse cases, a **fragmented development landscape** and a library fading away.

          A **high number of forks** in combination with **a lot of unanswered pull requests** often means that a library
          is **not actively maintained** at the moment.

    github_repo_watchers_count:
      label: Watchers
      description:

          This metric shows the **number of watchers** on this libraries GitHub source code repository.

          > You can watch a repository to receive notifications for new pull requests and issues that are created.
          >
          > <small>**Source: [GitHub Documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories/)**</small>

          A **high number of watchers** can indicate that **a lot of developers** are **interested or actively engaged** in the
          development of the given library, **increasing the likeliness** of the library **remaining maintained** in the long term.

          The **latest stable version number** of this library that was **published on Rubygems.org**.

          Many **projects in the Ruby community follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)**, which establishes
          a software versioning scheme that **limits breaking changes to major release numbers**.

          The **total number of package releases** of this library on Rubygems.org.

          A **high number of releases** over a **long timespan** often means that this library is **in a continuously maintained state**.

          However, if libraries issue **a lot of releases in bulk** it can also indicate that **releases are not always stable** and **need
          bugfix releases to keep backwards compatibility.**

          The **date of the latest release** of this library on Rubygems.org

          A library that **has not seen any releases in a long time** is **likely not under active development** and **often also not being
          actively maintained**.

          There are also **libraries that are simply "finished"** and therefore are **not touched again** for a while,
          but **often at least minor maintenance releases are required** every now and then to keep up with new Ruby
          versions or modified dependencies.

      description:

          The **total number of currently open issues** for this library's source code repository on GitHub.

          A **high number of open issues** can indicate that the **library is unmaintained**.
          However, it **can also mean that the library is so popular** that the maintainers are simply
          **not able to keep up with all incoming requests**. This might be a **good opportunity to help out** and
          **get active within the library's community**.

    github_repo_closed_issues_count:

      description:
        |
          The **total number of closed issues** for this library's source code repository on GitHub.

          A **high number of closed issues** often indicates that a **library is well-maintained** and
          **has a large user base**. Having **resolved a lot of bugs** also **increases the likeliness**
          of the **library being robust and stable**

          However, it can of course simply mean that the library has a ton of bugs ;)

    github_repo_total_issues_count:

          The **total number of issues** for this library's source code repository on GitHub.

          A **high number of issues** often indicates that a library **has a large user base**, so it's **more
          likely that edge-cases and uncommon usage scenarios have been identified and resolved.**

      icon: bug
    github_repo_issue_closure_rate:

      description:

          The **percentage of issues closed** for this library's source code repository on GitHub.

          A **high percentage** indicates that reported issues are being handled, often indicating that the project
          is maintained.

          If the **percentage is low** the library might be unmaintained, or the **library is so popular** that the
          maintainers are **overwhelmed by the amount of incoming requests**. This might be a **good opportunity to help out** and
          **get active within the library's community**.

          The **total number of open pull requests** for this library's source code repository on GitHub.

          A **large amount of open pull requests** can indicate a **vibrant development community** around
          the library. However, **if open pull requests go unanswered for a long time** the library **might
          not be maintained** anymore.

      icon: code-fork
    github_repo_closed_pull_requests_count:
      label: Closed Pull Requests
      description:
        |
          The **total number of rejected pull requests** for this library's source code repository on GitHub.

          **Closing a pull request without merging** the associated source code changes can have **many reasons**:

            * the proposed change might have been **solved in a different PR**
            * the project maintainers considered a proposed change **out of scope** for the library
            * the submitter of the PR may have **lost interest** and the PR has become stale
            * the proposed change may **not have met the quality standards** of the project

          In general, a **high number of closed pull requests** often indicates that a library has **a large community**
          and **incoming change proposals** are **considered and responded to by the maintainers**.

    github_repo_average_recent_committed_at:

          The **average date of the latest (up to) 50 commits** to this library's source code repository
          default branch on GitHub.

          A **recent date** often is a good indication that the **project is actively maintained**.

          However, **direct comparisons of this metric across libraries** are usually **not very helpful** as
          development flows can have **huge variance** - for example some maintainers might be making **lots of
          small commits**, others might make **single large ones** or **squash them when merging a pull request**,
          which has a very direct influence on this metric.

          Additionally, a library that is seeing **a lot of commits** might be **undergoing larger
          changes**, which could potentially **decrease backwards-compatibility**.
