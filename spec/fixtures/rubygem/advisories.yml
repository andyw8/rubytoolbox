    title: Nokogiri affected by libxslt Use of Uninitialized Resource/ Use After Free
      vulnerability
    cvss_v2: 5.1
    cvss_v3: 7.5
    criticality: high
    description: |
      In xsltCopyText in transform.c in libxslt 1.1.33, a pointer variable
      isn't reset under certain circumstances. If the relevant memory area
      happened to be freed and reused in a certain way, a bounds check could
      fail and memory outside a buffer could be written to, or uninitialized
      data could be disclosed.

      Nokogiri prior to version 1.10.5 contains a vulnerable version of
      libxslt. Nokogiri version 1.10.5 upgrades the dependency to
      libxslt 1.1.34, which contains a patch for this issue.
